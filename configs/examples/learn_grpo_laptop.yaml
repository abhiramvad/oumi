# Laptop-friendly GRPO training config
# Uses Qwen2 0.5B (smallest instruct model) for letter counting task
#
# Usage:
#   oumi train -c configs/examples/learn_grpo_laptop.yaml
#
# What this teaches:
#   - How GRPO works with reward functions
#   - Training on verifiable tasks (letter counting)
#   - Generating multiple responses per prompt
#
# Note: GRPO needs more memory than DPO due to generation.
# If this OOMs, reduce vllm_gpu_memory_utilization or use CPU.
